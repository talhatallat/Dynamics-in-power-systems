## Objective
The aim of this laboratory experiment is to understand the concept of transient stability of a power system when temporary faults occur in a power system.

## Introduction
The effects of temporary faults on the power system are analysed in the transient stability analysis, where swing curve of the generator rotor angle decides whether if the generator will remain connected to the power system even after the fault occurs. When the fault occurs all the power is going to ground so therefore, analyzing the system voltage and power flow. 

The system shown in figure 1 shows a generator connecting an infinite bus via two lines.

Figure 1 - Testing this power system

The system stability is going to be investigated using the given code and the multiple factors will 
be tested to see which affect stability. The clearing time (Tc) is the time permits until the breakers 
at points A and B switches, isolating the fault. 
Altering critical clearing time to measure the system stability. This time in seconds is used as a 
measure of the system stability to observe the longest time the breakers can remain closed until
instability take place
